    "### EDA Findings\n",
    "1. **Skewed Distribution of Charges**: The histogram shows that medical charges are right-skewed, with most individuals incurring lower costs and a few with very high costs, suggesting a need for log-transformation to normalize the target variable.\n",
    "2. **Smoker Status Impact**: The boxplot reveals that smokers incur significantly higher charges (median ~$35,000) compared to non-smokers (median ~$7,000), indicating smoker status as a critical predictor.\n",
    "3. **Age and Charges**: The scatterplot shows a positive relationship between age and charges, especially pronounced for smokers, suggesting an interaction effect between age and smoking.\n",
    "4. **BMI and Charges**: Higher BMI is associated with higher charges, particularly for smokers, indicating BMIâ€™s influence is amplified by smoking status.\n",
    "5. **Regional Variations**: Charges vary slightly by region, with the southeast showing slightly higher median charges, but the effect is less pronounced than smoking or age.\n",
    "6. **Correlations**: The correlation matrix shows moderate positive correlations between charges and age (0.3) and weak correlations with BMI (0.2) and children (0.07), reinforcing the importance of age and smoking status."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "The neural network effectively predicts medical costs (log-transformed charges) with reasonable accuracy, as evidenced by low train and test MAE values. The EDA revealed key predictors: smoker status, age, and BMI significantly influence charges, with smoking having the strongest impact. The model, with dropout and a moderate architecture, avoids overfitting and underfitting, as shown by converging training and validation losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendations\n",
    "1. **Feature Engineering**: Add interaction terms (e.g., `age*smoker`, `bmi*smoker`) to capture combined effects observed in EDA.\n",
    "2. **Model Improvement**: Experiment with hyperparameter tuning (e.g., learning rate, number of layers) using grid search to optimize performance.\n",
    "3. **Ethical Considerations**: Ensure fairness in predictions across regions and demographics, as regional variations were observed. Avoid bias against high-BMI or older individuals.\n",
    "4. **Deployment**: Integrate the model into insurance systems for cost estimation, but validate with real-world data to ensure generalizability.\n",
    "5. **Further Analysis**: Investigate outliers in charges to understand extreme cases and refine the model."
